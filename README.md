An example of quality control software written for analyzing nanowire growth on copper cryo-electron microscopy grids.

![](https://github.com/irazinkov/Portfolio/blob/master/grid-qc.PNG)

As part of the manufacturing process of the novel nanowire copper grids, the grids are exposed to a chemical reaction to grow nanowires  directly on the copper surface. Each individual grid is then examined under a light microscope, where the images are taken and automatically processed through this software.

Custom image analysis code provides provides a individual score for each grid.

Next, a classification algorithm (we call it 'Santa') decides if the grid is "good" or "bad".

Software package for controlling Spotiton, a robotic liquid dispenser designed for freezing samples for cryo-electron microscopy. The software integrates and automates motion, video processing and logic control to guide the user efficiently through all the necessary steps for preparing a cryo-EM sample.

Software for control of a device called DAW, a system that dynamically changes fluid pressures inside a microfluidic device. It is used to dynamically expose cells (bacterial, yeast and mamallian) in a microfluidic device to changing chemical environment. For example, cells could be exposed to a metabolite (sugar), hormone (acyl-homoserine lactone) or even an antibiotic.
