An example of quality control software written for analyzing nanowire growth on copper cryo-electron microscopy grids.

![](https://i.imgur.com/D6P0c3J.png)

As part of the manufacturing process of the novel nanowire copper grids, the grids are exposed to a chemical reaction to grow nanowires directly on the copper surface. Each individual grids is then examined under a light microscope, where the images are taken and automatically processed through this software.
Custom image analysis code provides provides a individual score for each grid, following a machine learning step of classification into "bad" and "good" grids.

<details><summary>Defocus refinement</summary><p>

Defocus estimation in Appion-Protomo is performed using TomoCTF, which measures the defocus of the untilted plane by tiling all tilt images together while taking into account the relative heights of each tile in order to use all of the signal in the tilt-series. This method of defocus estimation assumes that each tilt image's center was recorded with the sample at the same z-height in the microscope. This requires perfect tracking during collection, which is rarely achieved. As a result, Thon rings often become incoherent before they fade away towards Nyquist.

After tiling, TomoCTF searches monotonically from just below the lower defocus range requested to the top of the range. Often, the search finds the defocus that is one zero off from the correct defocus and so needs to be refined using a proper search range.

- From the Protomo Alignment Summary webpage, click on `Refine defocus`.

- On the next page, select the correct tilt-series number, change the defocus range appropriately, and edit other parameters appropriately.

Select `Just Show Command` at the bottom of the page.

<details><summary>Protomo refinement basics</summary><p>

Protomo refinement is described with some mathematical clarity in the Protomo user's guide found on the original [Protomo website](http://www.electrontomography.org/).

Conceptually, Protomo alignment combines common lines and iterative preliminary weighted back-projection > reprojection correlation methods along with a robust geometry model of the entire stage and sample in order to effectively maximize SNR/contrast in the weighted back-projection, which might be equivalent to aligning the tilt-series if alignment parameters are chosen appropriately. As a result, tilt-series alignment with Protomo does not require fiducials or features, only SNR.

Appion-Protomo refinement on a coarsely aligned tilt-series generally proceeds as follows:

1. Pre-process all tilt images with lowpass and highpass filters, a median or gaussian filter, gradient subtraction, pixel intensity thresholds, masks, and mask lowpass and highpass apodization filters. All images are then binned during the first several Round of refinement.

2. A reference image is chosen (usually the tilt image closest to 0°). This image will not be moved during each refinement iteration.

3. The two images on either side of the reference image are aligned to the reference image by correlation inside of a given search area.

4. These three aligned tilt images are weighted back-projected into a preliminary 3D reconstruction.

5. The preliminary 3D reconstruction is then re-projected in the direction of the next highest tilt angle and the corresponding tilt image is then aligned (rotation, translation, and/or isotropic stretching) to this reprojection inside of a given search area.

   - Alignment by correlation allows for sub-pixel accuracy. The alignment algorithm also allows for an estimation of the alignment error in rotation, translation, and/or stretching because it is calculated by matrix diagnolization, which numerically results in non-zero off-diagonal terms left over.

6. These four aligned tilt images are weighted back-projected into a preliminary 3D reconstruction, and 5. proceeds with the next highest tilt image on the opposite side of the last-aligned tilt image (ie. alternating alignment).

This process (4. and 5.) continues until all tilt images have been aligned.

7. After all tilt images are aligned, Protomo re-estimates the entire tilt model geometry (tilt azimuth, tilt elevation, and/or sample orientation in the ice).

8. Steps 1. through 7. are repeated over dozens of iterations with less and less strict binning and filtering.

Tilt-series alignment quality is then assessed automatically by plotting the iterations versus the errors in alignment (see 5. indent), and should be additionally assessed by the user by checking tilt model geometry stability, that the alignment thickness has been chosen appropriately, and by simply watching the aligned tilt-series videos.

</p></details>

<details><summary>Protomo refinement metrics</summary><p>

As described in the Protomo refinement basics section above, Protomo estimates the accuracy with which it could align each tilt image rotationally, translationally, and/or with stretching. These errors, called correction factors, are expressed as a percentage of image length for translation and stretching, and in degrees for rotation. Correction factors are a measure of uncorrectable tilt image alignment error given the geometry model and the amount of uncorrectable drift, beam-induced motion, doming, and charging of the specimen during collection.

When you click on a refinement iteration summary, you will see four correction factor plots that show the estimated alignment error for each tilt image in the x-direction, y-direction, rotationally, and/or in stretching. The goal is to select the iteration (given sufficiently accurate alignment parameters - binning, lowpass, alignment thickness, etc.) with the least amount of errors. A good rule of thumb is that all tilt images should have correction factors below 1% (and 1° for rotation) before considering reconstruction and post-processing.

Each correction factor plot, except for rotation, additionally has plotted the mean correction factor (solid line) plus/minus one standard deviation (dotted lines). Green lines are good, red lines are bad.

**_<details><summary>Click for image</summary><p>_**

![](https://i.imgur.com/dnPfPXw.png)

</p></details>
<br />

To simplify the assessment of these correction factors, a combined metric (CCMS plot) is plotted on the main refinement summary webpages:

- The dotted orange line records the average + 1 standard deviation of the x correction factor and y correction factor, summed.
- The x'd orange line records the average + 1 standard deviation of the stretching correction factor.
- The blue line records the average + 1 standard deviation of the rotation correction factor.
- The black line is a scaled sum of the above three lines

The goal then becomes to minimize the black line.

To simplify this process further, the main Protomo Alignment Summary webpage locates the lowest points on the black line and grades the alignment quality depending on how low the line is at that iteration: Bad, Okay, Good, Very Good, Excellent, Perfection!, and Suspiciously Perfect...

As a secondary metric, the stability of the geometry model should be checked.

<details><summary>CTF correction</summary><p>

Currently Appion-Protomo in Docker does not include tilt-series CTF correction. We have not yet robustly tested TomoCTF correction in Appion-Protomo to ensure that tilt-series are being CTF corrected properly.

CTF correction can be accomplished through a number of different methods that are not discussed in depth here.

The following list orders CTF estimation and correction methods by their approximate accuracy (from most accurate to least) based on a typically-collected tilt-series of a reasonably thick specimen (~100+ nm) with uniformly-distributed particles in the z-direction:

- Per-particle tilt image fine estimation and correction that takes into account overlapping objects in each tilt image of each particle and accounts for the 3D location of each particle.

- Per-particle tilt image fine estimation and correction that accounts for the 3D location of each particle.

- Collecting high-dose focus images on either side of the target along the tilt axis for every tilt image and using the average of those defocus estimations along with the known 3D locations of particles to correct (given that the focus images are at a known height relative to the field of view of interest).

- Per-tilt-series estimation and correction based on the accumulated SNR of the entire tilt-series, often found by tiling each tilt image together.

- Per-tomogram estimation based on sufficient sub-tomogram processing where the zeros are found in the resulting sub-tomogram alignment's FSC curve.

- Per-tilt image estimation and correction.

<details><summary>PHP issues</summary><p>

Appion's, and thus Appion-Protomo's, front-end is built on PHP and thus inherits PHP's complications. The main issue that you as a user may find annoying is that sometimes it seems that Appion-Protomo webpages forget the tilt-series you were working on or complain that you haven't entered in something basic like pixelsize. This is often because PHP SESSION variables have been been cleared from your browser's cache. To refresh Appion-Protomo you must reload these SESSION variables. You can do this by:

- Navigate to Align Tilt-Series

- On the next page click `Protomo 2.4.1`.

- On the next page, Protomo Coarse Alignment, select the tilt-series you wish to align from the box.

At this point all SESSION variables required for using Batch Align Tilt-Series, for instance, should be loaded.

Note that clicking on Align Tilt-Series forcefully clears all PHP variables.
