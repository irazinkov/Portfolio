An example of quality control software written for analyzing nanowire growth on copper cryo-electron microscopy grids.

As part of the manufacturing process of the novel nanowire copper grids, the grids are exposed to a chemical reaction to grow nanowires  directly on the copper surface. Each individual grid is then examined under a light microscope, where the images are taken and automatically processed through this software.

Custom image analysis code provides provides a individual score for each grid.

Next, a classification algorithm (we call it 'Santa') decides if the grid is "good" or "bad".
